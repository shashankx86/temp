## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the API, including routes, middleware, and other important aspects of the implementation. It also includes example commands and expected outputs for each route.

## General Notes

- Ensure that the `.env` file is properly configured with `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `PORT`, and `WEBSOCKET_PORT`.
- The private and public keys should be stored in the `keys` directory with filenames `private_key.pem` and `public_key.pem`.
- Logging is set up to append to `serve.log`.
